# ReadMe Sync

> Inspired by, and based on, [@sinch/readme-sync](https://github.com/sinch/readme-sync). This is intended to answer the same major use cases, while making small modifications to handle modernizations to ReadMe's API and to improve QOL.

**This utility is still under construction, full functionality may not be available.**

This is a CLI application that allows users to synchronize local Markdown documentation with ReadMe sites via their public API.
